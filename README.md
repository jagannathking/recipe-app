*   A Spoonacular API Key (get one from [spoonacular.com/food-api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api))

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory (assuming it's named `backend`):
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Install backend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:
        ```env
        PORT=5000 # Or any port you prefer
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret_key
        SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_spoonacular_api_key
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Navigate to the frontend directory (assuming it's named `frontend`):
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        ```
    *   Install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the backend API URL:
        ```env
        # Make sure this matches where your backend server will run
        REACT_APP_API_URL=https://vercel.com/jagannaths-projects-36d87af2/recipe-app/BjYWiv3Y4VCAEd2j5WBTH4TdzVKW
        ```

### Running the App

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *   Open a terminal in the `backend` directory:
        ```bash
        npm start
        # Or if you have a dev script: npm run dev
        ```
    *   The backend should be running (e.g., on `https://vercel.com/jagannaths-projects-36d87af2/recipe-app/BjYWiv3Y4VCAEd2j5WBTH4TdzVKW`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    *   Open *another* terminal in the `frontend` directory:
